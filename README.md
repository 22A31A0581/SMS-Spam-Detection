# SMS-Spam-Detection
# ðŸ“± SMS Spam Detection with Machine Learning

This project implements an SMS Spam Detection system using Python and machine learning techniques. It classifies SMS messages as either **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using natural language processing and classification algorithms.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Binary classification: Spam vs Ham
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction (TF-IDF)
- Model training using Random Forest
- Model evaluation with accuracy and classification report
- Easily extendable to other classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.)

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

- Random Forest Classifier
- Optionally test with other models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)


## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

Install the necessary Python packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sms-spam-detection.git
cd sms-spam-detection
