# 📱 SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning
# 🧠 Overview

This project is a Machine Learning-based SMS Spam Detector that classifies text messages as Spam or Ham (Non-Spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Logistic Regression model.
It uses the TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) method to convert message text into numerical feature vectors for model training and prediction.


# 🧩 Features

Preprocessing of text messages using TF-IDF vectorization

Logistic Regression model for binary classification

High accuracy (~96%) on both training and testing data

Real-time message prediction feature

# 🧰 Technologies Used

Python 🐍

NumPy and Pandas for data handling

Scikit-learn (sklearn) for model building and evaluation

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab for development and visualization
